<h1>CL-PROJ provides bindings for the Proj.4 library </h1><p>PROJ.4 is a cartographic projections library originally written by Gerald Evenden then of the USGS. PROJ.4 has been placed under an MIT license. </p><p>CL-PROJ provides CFFI-based Common Lisp bindings for the PROJ.4 library. It is placed under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license meaning that you can do almost everything you want with it. </p><p>PROJ.4 homepage is: <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/</a> </p><p>CL-PROJ homepage is: <a href="http://cl-proj.sourceforge.net/">http://cl-proj.sourceforge.net/</a> and the project page is: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cl-proj/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cl-proj/</a> </p><p>Released files can be downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cl-proj/files">the downloads page</a>. And it can also be installed using the <code>asdf-install</code> program. </p><h1>Usage </h1><p>Typical library loading and linking into the Lisp image would be: </p><pre><code>(require 'cffi)  
(cffi:define-foreign-library libproj (t (:default "libproj")))  
(cffi:load-foreign-library 'libproj)  
(require 'cl-proj) </code></pre><p>Symbols are defined in the <code>cl-proj</code> package and are also available using the <code>pj</code> package nickname. </p><p>By now the native libproj shared library should be loaded and linked into the Lisp image and all the bindings should be resolved. </p><p>Constants, variables and functions are extremely close to the PROJ.4. API is documented in the <api.html>  file that is supplied in the distribution. </p><h1>Copying </h1><pre><code>Copyright (c) 2012, Victor Anyakin &lt;anyakinvictor@yahoo.com&gt;
