is used to refine the solution.

  "A simple interface for computing the area of a geodesic polygon.

@param[in] g a pointer to the geod_geodesic object specifying the
  ellipsoid.
@param[in] lats an array of latitudes of the polygon vertices (degrees).
@param[in] lons an array of longitudes of the polygon vertices (degrees).
@param[in] n the number of vertices.
@param[out] pA pointer to the area of the polygon (meters<sup>2</sup>).
@param[out] pP pointer to the perimeter of the polygon (meters).

\e lats should be in the range [&minus;90&deg;, 90&deg;].

Only simple polygons (which are not self-intersecting) are allowed.
There's no need to 'close' the polygon by repeating the first vertex.  The
area returned is signed with counter-clockwise traversal being treated as
positive.

Example, compute the area of Antarctica:
@code{.c}
double
